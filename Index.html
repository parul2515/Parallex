<h2>WHAT HAPPENED THAT DAY ?<br>(MYSTERY SOLVED)</h2>
    <p>
     On the afternoon of 4 August 2020, a large fire broke out in Warehouse 12 at the Port of Beirut. The waterside Warehouse 12 was situated next to the grain silo and stored the ammonium nitrate that had been confiscated from MV Rhosus alongside a "stash" of fireworks. Around 17:55 local time (14:55 UTC), a team of nine firefighters and one paramedic was dispatched to fight the fire. On arrival the fire crew reported there was "something wrong" as the fire was huge and produced "a crazy sound ..."
The first explosion, at about 18:07 local time (15:07 UTC), sent up a cloud of smoke followed by flashes of light from the stored fireworks; the second, occurring approximately 33 to 35 seconds later, was much more substantial. It rocked central Beirut and sent a red-orange cloud into the air, which was briefly surrounded by a white condensation cloud. The orange-red colour of the smoke was caused by nitrogen dioxide, a byproduct of ammonium nitrate decomposition. The second explosion was felt in northern Israel and in Cyprus, 240 kilometers (150 miles) away.

Despite inefficient transmission of the shock waves into the ground, the United States Geological Survey measured the event as a 3.3 local magnitude earthquake, while the Jordan Seismological Observatory reported that it was equivalent to a 4.5 local magnitude earthquake. Specialists from the University of Sheffield estimated that the explosion was one of the biggest non-nuclear explosions in history. The Beirut explosion was similar to explosions of large amounts of ammonium nitrate in Tianjin, China, in 2015; or in Texas City, United States, in 1947. By the next morning, the main fire was extinguished and the situation was under control.
